Branching allows developers to isolate their work from the main codebase, ensuring that the production-ready code remains stable while new features are in progress. This isolation enables multiple team members to work on different parts of the project simultaneously without interfering with each other's changes. By utilizing branches, teams can prevent critical issues such as broken builds, unintentional overwriting of files, and premature integration of unfinished code.
